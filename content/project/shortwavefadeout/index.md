This study is about how energetic electromagnetic eruptions (solar flares) coming from the Sun alter the physical properties of the ionosphere which affects the over the horizon high-frequency (HF: 3-30 MHz) radio communication channels, commonly known as short-wave fadeout (SWF). The study characterizes different facts and features of SWF seen in daytime observations of the SuperDARN HF radar (a monostatic HF transceiver system, which simulates a two-way HF communication link) and riometers during different solar flare events. The study also demonstrates how the physical location of HF transmitter/receiver, HF transmitter frequency, and intensity of solar flare impacts SWF.
